------------
GAME MODE
------------


---------------------------------------

----------------------------------------


HP is raw stat gain, not percent


- add anim for slash of attacking

- add anim for if gaining buff of atk, def, mov, hp as well - this anim is just a gameobject that is a cylender with boated bottom and smaller top with sphereize to circle char that gets buff - happens in order with ienumerator for each char at end of turn (no game stalls for this - happens when you move as well for initial) [so if not 0, do cool particle effect with mat and 3d model instantiate]

TO MODEL AND TEXTURE:
- add erupting [cracking] terrain (does damage if stand on at start of turn
- purple bush for posion
- thorn bush
- make null tile (movment cost of 100, but is nothing - still has selectable and raycast box
- make button in map selector to choose from scroll list of sky boxes for map athstetics


?- make an terrain that clears stat buffs if tileID is stood on (bush with sparkles from radial material and sparkle texture and repeat --- called "magic bush")

--------------------------------

- make an ability inverse stat changes (use my func)
- make attack animations longer - get into stance, and then take a big slash, then make hurt a longer stagger
- fix the white lines for webGL ?!



make more tiles:
- plains have texture generics for floor - I also have 0 shadow versions
- need to add to ScrollView in mapmaker maker an image 
- need to add to static map maker selecting the option and link to image button in scroll view
- PopulateMapMaker - needs to add game object there
- need to add to tile look up obj (3d model and stats)
- make option selected tag
- add box collider


- 3 types of terrain in planes mat for ground mat (3 world personalitys)



show weapon when using second ability as well - add abilities - and make abilities based on range use movment logic - but if not -100, then -1 always (then wall will block sword abilities) - and other ones can be handled diffrently

add weapon view to char maker (only primary - change when weapon changes) - write down in char maker the currently selected weapons [have box that is empty until you select as well]

- post processing

- make more weapons and animations

- add local match saver

use unity jobs

optimise


[web GL full]


to do online:
- save entire map and send to other plaer (S) after every action that ends a unit turn (reloads map of other players)
- only can act and send map data if you are the active player for that unit color


add wireless match maker

add wireless match finder

add map online uploader

add map online downloader

add touch click support?






gonna implement a few test abilities - then I will do more weapons, abilities, ect: then the game will feel more complete and have enjoyment to be had. 

Saving local match results comes next - then online map downloader, then online play


USE TODO Email - email says to do attack range - all of it with min range max, all drawing, damage, health bar, and such

https://www.studica.com/blog/unity-tutorial-animator-controllers
^^ talks about coding - and triggers

Hide Weapons when moving?

need levels of damage animations!??!?! (light, heavy, stagger [knifes], very heavy, 


to stylize I will make a background image? and add shader effects? - post processing
