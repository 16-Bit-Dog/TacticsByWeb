done()?{
- (string.replace("persistant data path)).replace(".dat") to remove trash from strings
}

todo now:

- // TODO: LOAD ATTACK FUNC AND SUCH, SAME FOR MOVE FUNC!
- you can click attack even if not in range - it just shows where you can attack with bar animated square thing

- : Repopulate Menu Items
- need to also add range of pri weapon to printer - range of primary only - put secondary as question mark



- need to draw map once I pass through, add moving cam, and draw char with hat 
- need to do body stuff
- need to make a mid sequence to take in info to pass into LocalMatch-Phase Scene
- draw char with hat and body armor once loaded as well, remove placeholder item with char - highlight them with shader of color so you know the team they are apart of 
        //TODO: retrive HP, atk, move, ect values once I add them
(need to load chars and look at em and make sure you selected all chars - you then select to pass file path - then I need to move all into corrsponding vector of charData
- delete all char and hat and body objects from main thinggy so I can load battle scene



- NEED TO ALSO ADD STATS and make the BATTLE THING

1. weapon system: email has more info

you have primary and secondary weapons for each weapon type:
- primary weapon slot can use primary and secondary weapons of selected type (like swords)
- secondary weapon slot can use secondary weapons of selected type (like daggers)
This way we have a simple weapon equip and class system 

we can also allow 1 item [ignore for now]? - then simple inventory system is made!
- stats are based on primary weapon
- secondary weapon is essentially just for another wepon with stats -- all wepaons reduce stats


we have HP, atk, def, spd, and (result of all the above maybe? dodge?)
